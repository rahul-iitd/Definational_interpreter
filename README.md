# Definational_interpreter
Defined abstract syntax (data type exp) and a definitional interpreter eval for a simple arithmetic and boolean calculation language.
The expressions in the language are of the following forms

1. Integer constants

2. Unary arithmetic operations: abs

3. Identifiers, represented as (alphanumeric) strings

4. binary operations: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), div, mod, ^ (exponentiation)

5. Boolean constants: T and F

6. Unary boolean operation: not

7. binary boolean operations:  /\ (and), \/ (or), -> (implies)

8. Comparison operators: = (equal) , > (greater than), < (less than) , >= (greater or equal), <= (less or equal) on integer expressions

9. n-tuples for each n > 2

10. Projection operators proj(i,n) which project the ith element of an n-tuple.


Assume all inputs are of proper type (we will study type-checking later).  Defined a suitable data type answer.



eval: exp -> answer.

Next, defined a suitable set of opcodes for a stack-and-table machine to evaluate this language and define a compiler for this language to sequences of these opcodes.

compile: exp -> opcode list

Third, defined the stack machine execution functions, which takes a sequence of opcodes and executes them starting from a given stack and table.

execute: stack * table * opcode list -> answer

It has enough exaples to support check the interpreter.
